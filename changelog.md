# Alchemistry 1.18.2 Alpha

This update brings a complete rewrite of Alchemistry from the ground up reimplementing the same features you know and love (with a few new things). This is an alpha release. A few things aren't finish yet such as all of the recipes, a few models, new menus, menu buttons, etc. We will be working to add all of that and more soon.

Since this version is an alpha, it will have a number of bugs. We know about a bunch of them and just need to work on them one step at a time. If you find a bug, check the GitHub issues to see if it's already been reported (for 1.18.2 and the new version). If it hasn't, please provide as much information as you can to help us get it fixed.

Over the next few weeks and months, we will be working to make this release as stable as possible, complete all of the features that should be in Alchemistry and more, and fix outstanding bugs before it has a full release. After all of that, we will update to 1.19. Don't ask for that version as we already plan to do it.
